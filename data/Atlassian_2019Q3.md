# Atlassian - Non-IFRS Financial Measures

# About Non-IFRS Financial Measures

Our reported results and financial targets include certain non-IFRS financial measures, including non-IFRS gross profit, non-IFRS operating income, non-IFRS net income, non-IFRS net income per diluted share, and free cash flow. Management believes that the use of these non-IFRS financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with peer companies, many of which use similar non-IFRS or non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their IFRS or GAAP results. Non-IFRS results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only to aid in understanding our operating results. The non-IFRS results should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, and may be different from non-IFRS or non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

# Our non-IFRS financial measures include:

- Non-IFRS gross profit. Excludes expenses related to share-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets.
- Non-IFRS operating income. Excludes expenses related to share-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets.
- Non-IFRS net income and non-IFRS net income per diluted share. Excludes expenses related to share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, non-coupon impact related to exchangeable senior notes and capped calls, the related income tax effects on these items, and changes in our assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets.
- Free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which consists of purchases of property and equipment.

# Adjustments reflected in our non-IFRS financial measures:

- Share-based compensation
- Amortization of acquired intangible assets
- Non-coupon impact related to exchangeable senior notes and capped calls:
- Amortization of notes discount and issuance costs
- Mark to fair value of the exchangeable senior notes exchange feature
- Mark to fair value of the related capped call transactions
- The related income tax effects on these items, and changes in our assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets

We exclude expenses related to share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, non-coupon impact related to exchangeable senior notes and capped calls, the related income tax effects on these items, and changes in our assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets from certain of our non-IFRS financial measures as we believe this helps investors understand our operational performance. In addition, share-based compensation expense can be difficult to predict and varies from period to period and company to company due to differing valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of equity instruments, as well as changes in stock price.

Management considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening our statement of financial position.

Management uses non-IFRS gross profit, non-IFRS operating income, non-IFRS net income, non-IFRS net income per diluted share, and free cash flow:

- As measures of operating performance, because these financial measures do not include the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations;
- For planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget;
- To allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business;
- To evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies;
# Atlassian Press Release - Q3 2019

# Atlassian Press Release - Quarter 3, 2019

This document contains unaudited financial statements and relevant disclosures filed by Atlassian for the third quarter of 2019 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

During this quarter, Atlassian communicated its financial performance to the Board of Directors. The tables titled “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” and “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Financial Targets” provide reconciliations of non-IFRS financial measures to the most recent directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS.

It is important to note that non-IFRS financial measures such as non-IFRS gross profit, non-IFRS operating income, non-IFRS net income, non-IFRS net income per diluted share, and free cash flow, while commonly used by investors and securities analysts, have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of results of operations as reported under IFRS.
